## Description
You can use the commands in two ways, through text or through a Discord Slash Command.

Slash commands do not have a lot of the same commands as text commands, but they are still useful for certain situations.

## Text Commands
You can find the list of available commands with their brief descriptions by using the `help` command.

You can also find their detailed descriptions here: [Text Commands](./text/index.md)

The prefix will most likely stay static, but as of now it is `;`.

With text commands you will kind of have to guess the arguments positions, but their description will most likely show you a format.

## Slash Commands
You can find the list of available commands with their brief descriptions by looking at their descriptions like this:

You can also find their detailed descriptions here: [Slash Commands](./slash/index.md)

With slash commands you will see arguments when you execute them.
