# Moderation
You can be blacklisted permanently from using the bot at any time without prior notice. If you wish to appeal your ban, please open a ban-appeal ticket at [Grid Bot Support](https://github.com/mfdlabs/grid-bot/issues).

# Appealing Blacklisting
If you wish to appeal your blacklist or you think you were wrongly blacklisted, please contact the primary developer on a platform like Discord or by contacting them with their email or we urge you to open a ban-appeal ticket at [Grid Bot Support](https://github.com/mfdlabs/grid-bot/issues)

!!! caution "Final say"

    Moderators have the final say in if you were blacklisted or not. 
    If your appeal is denied, you will not be able to use the bot again and you will be dissallowed to appeal again.
