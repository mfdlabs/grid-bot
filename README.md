# How do I contribute?

Very easily!

Look at Jira to find out what has to be done, and find something that is either being worked on (ask the person who is working on it if you can help) or find something else that isn't dependant on something else to be finished!

# Issues

Please don't refrain from opening issues!

This will help the primary members of the Web Team to identify issues that arise, please open them on Jira and Github Enterprise (or Github if working abroad and do not require internal access)
